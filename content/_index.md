# Bonk

[Bonk](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonTools.Core.Bonk) is a fast and modular collision detection system for MonoGame that is part of the MoonTools suite.

Bonk **is** designed to help you figure out if two shapes are overlapping and by how much.

Bonk **is not** a physics simulator and it will not help you execute collision responses. 

Bonk is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MoonTools.Core.Bonk/).

Bonk is licensed under the [LGPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). In summary: feel free to include it in your closed-source game and modify it internally at will, but if you make changes that you intend to redistribute, you **must** freely publish your changes.
